# Chat-Room
This is the uploading of a school assignment done in JAVA.

As such, the project is thoroughly commented so this document should serve as a quick step-by-step guide to getting the project running. 
All files must be present within the same package as they all rely on bits and pieces of each other. 

To run the GUI interface: 
Run the ServerGUI class first which prompts a frame with a dialog box with '1500' to appear. Hit start and a welcome message will appear.
Upon receiving the welcome message, run the ClientGUI class. You will recieve a dialog box in which you can enter a username and join the chat. 

After joining the chat, there are several functionalities to test:
1. Sending a message, to send a message in the chatroom. 
2. Using the who is in button, to know who else is present in the chatroom. 
3. Logout button, to exit the chat.
